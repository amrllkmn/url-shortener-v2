# URL Shortener V2
This is the second version of my URL Shortener. It is a simple URL Shortener that uses a database to store the URLs and their shortened versions. It is written in Rust and uses the Actix Web framework. Once the server is running, you can access the website (linked will be added here shortly).

## How to run
To run the server, you need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Once you have Rust installed, you can clone the repository and run the following command:
```bash
cargo run
```
This will start the server on port 8080. You can change the port by setting the port number on `main.rs`. Once the server is running, you can access the website by going to `localhost:8080` (or whatever port you set it to).
